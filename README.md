# Everly

[Everly](https://everly.sh) is a whitelabel serverless YouTube and Twitch notification bot, for $10 / lifetime

## Why open source it if it's paid?

Because open source software is awesome. I understand people will be able to host their own instances, and thus will reduce funding towards me, but that's okay. Payment of Everly is purely to support my development efforts, as the costs to actually run it are close to nothing; so nothing is lost due to the cause of this open-source nature.

## Contributing

At this stage, Everly is pretty much finished. There's nothing currently planned, and there's no major bugs. But if you think of anything, feel free to make an issue!

## Tech

Everly is built on the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction#the-t3-stack) which is aimed to allow developers to move as fast as possible.

## License

As of right now, Everly isn't licensed. This means you're not allowed to do anything with the code itself. It's open sourced for contributions and visibility.
